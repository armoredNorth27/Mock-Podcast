Compilation and running Instructions:
	1) Download the "assignment2.zip" folder and unzip it
	   in the location where you want to test the assignment.

	2) Open a terminal and navigate into the assignment2
	   directory.
	
	3) Run the command "make" in order to compile and link all
	   .cc files into a single executable.
	
	4) Run the command "./a2" in order to run the executable
	   that's been generated. You can also run the executable
	using "valgrind ./a2" in order to check if any memory
	leaks occurred during the runtime of the program.

	5) You can run the command "make clean" to remove all
	.o files and the executable that was generated by the
